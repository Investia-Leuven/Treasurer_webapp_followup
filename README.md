### 🔄 How the Files Work Together

#### ✅ Streamlit UI (`streamlit_app.py`)
- Calls functions from `lib/ui/*` to render modular UI
- Uses `forms.py` to get input
- Submits data via `lib/db.py`
- Manages mailing list with `mailing.py`
- All logging goes through `lib/logging.py`

#### ✅ Background Processor (`main.py`)
- Loads environment via `lib/config.py`
- Fetches ticker list from `lib/db.py`
- For each row:
  - Runs `process_row()` from `notifications/processing.py`
  - This uses:
    - `yfinance` for live data
    - `news.py` for headlines
    - `email.py` for sending emails
- Logs structured events using `logging.py`

#### ✅ Notifications
- `processing.py` checks price thresholds and triggers
- `email.py` formats the HTML and sends via SMTP
- `news.py` extracts 3 headlines from Yahoo Finance for inclusion

#### ✅ Supabase Interface (`db.py`)
- Unified access point for:
  - Inserting, updating stocks
  - Managing mailing list
  - Fetching watchlist
- Used by both `streamlit_app.py` and `main.py`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Set either in `.env` (for local) or `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (for Streamlit Cloud):

SUPABASE_KEY=your-service-key

EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587

DAILY_CHANGE_THRESHOLD=4.0
MARKET_OPEN_HOUR_UTC=13
MARKET_OPEN_MINUTE_UTC=30
```

---

## 🖥️ Running Locally

To run the UI:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

To run the alert processor manually:
```bash
python main.py
```

This can also be automated via GitHub Actions or any scheduler.

## 📨 Email Notification Triggers

| Type             | Trigger                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Bear case        | `last_close <= bear_price`                    |
| Bull case        | `last_close >= bull_price`                    |
| Daily change     | Abs(%) change >= threshold from yesterday     |

Each notification is sent only **once per condition** and is reset as follows:

- Bear/Bull: reset after 7 days if not updated
- Daily: reset next market day after open

---

## 📬 Mailing List

- Users can add/remove emails from a global mailing list
- Stored in the Supabase table `mailing_list`
- Every notification goes to stock-specific + global mailing emails

---

Emails include:

- Type of alert (e.g., "Bear case hit")
- Current price
- Target prices (bear/base/bull)
- Investment thesis (Pros/Cons)
- Latest 3 news articles with links
